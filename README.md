# Hello and welcome to Multicast Mobile!
This app explores non-native multicast streaming for live video content.

To run this code:
1. You must download the following libraries (using pip install): kivy, kivymd, pillow, ffpyplayer
2. Then, use your terminal to run "python demo_main.py". Please note that if you are not on a Linux device, the video streaming section will not work, so the camera icon will crash the app. However, the rest of the app still functions correctly.

If you ARE on a Linux device, open the file "demo.kv". Uncomment lines 39-42, which will allow the camera to work.
